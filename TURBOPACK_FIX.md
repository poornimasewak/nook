# Turbopack Error Fix

## Problem
You encountered a Turbopack internal error with Next.js 16:
```
TurbopackInternalError: inner_of_uppers_lost_follower is not able to remove follower
```

This is a known issue with Next.js 16's experimental Turbopack bundler.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Cleared Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
```

### 2. Disabled Turbopack (Using Stable Webpack Instead)
Updated `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev --turbo=false"
}
```

The server now uses webpack instead of Turbopack, which is more stable.

## 🚀 Server Status

The dev server should now be running at:
- **http://localhost:3000**
- **http://localhost:3000/login** - Login page
- **http://localhost:3000/chatroom** - Chat room

## 🔍 If Issues Persist

### Option 1: Full Clean Install
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Use Different Port
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Option 3: Check Node Version
Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed:
```bash
node --version
```

### Option 4: Downgrade Next.js (Last Resort)
If webpack is still having issues, you can downgrade:
```bash
npm install next@15.1.4
```

## 📝 What Changed

- **Before**: `next dev` (uses Turbopack by default in Next.js 16)
- **After**: `next dev --turbo=false` (uses stable webpack)

## ✨ Benefits of Using Webpack

- ✅ More stable and mature
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Wider community support
- ✅ No experimental bugs
- ⚠️ Slightly slower than Turbopack (but more reliable)

## 🎯 Test Your App

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter name and email
3. Check terminal for OTP
4. Verify it works!
